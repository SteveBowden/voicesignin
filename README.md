This repo contains snippets, samples and contributions to client and server side code interacting with the voicesignin API.

Grab the code snippets from here and get your API keys from the voicesignin.com developer portal (https://developer.voicesignin.com).

Voicesignin is a an innovative way for developers to authenticate their users' sessions on voice first services such as Alexa without having to link a device with an account. This is for situations when the service consumer is at a friend's house or using a shared public device. The voicesignin.com service requires a simple multifactor check which is achieved by pushing a request to a user rather than traditional MFA which would require users to awkwardly quote six digit numbers before the code times out.

The voicesignin.com platform is completly serverless and leverages AWS S3 for durable and encrypted data storage. Auth0 is used to register developers and link a consumer's voice identity with the user's master account. The platform provides a developer portal for setting up and managing API keys.

The platform is fully scalable, automated and controlled by high level confirgurations designed to minimize costs and buffer the impact of abuse. The platform is completely free for consumers and developrs will always have a substantial quota bundled into a free tier. As the product matures, premium features will be introduced in areas such as perfomance, quotas, rates and customization.
