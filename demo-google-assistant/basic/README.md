A quick copy past sample code for adding to DialogFlow console in the fullfullment section. You will also need to set up two intents (provide_vname and check_status). 

Use the attached csv files to upload the lookup list into the entities section (@v_color, @v_animal and @v_city) and refer to them in the provide_name intent as follows:

I'm the @v_color @v_animal of @v_city

There are a few other little settings so please refer to screen shots of set up.
